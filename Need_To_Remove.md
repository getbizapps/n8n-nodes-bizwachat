## APIs to Review/Remove

At this stage, all newly added Contact and Contact Group endpoints are based on standard RESTful conventions and the Bizwachat API Guide. If you find any endpoints in the code that do NOT exist in the official Bizwachat API Guide, please highlight them here for removal or review.

- `/contacts` (GET, POST)
- `/contacts/{id}` (PUT, DELETE)
- `/contact-groups` (GET, POST)
- `/contact-groups/{id}` (PUT, DELETE)

**If any of these endpoints are not present in your API Guide, please comment below and remove them from the code.**
